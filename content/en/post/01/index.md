## ðŸ“Œ Week of May 26 to June 1

This week marked the start of a new academic cycle. It was a bit exciting and a little stressful at first because the business informatics subjects seemed quite extensive. What stood out most were the first lectures on information systems â€” the lecturer shared real-life implementation cases from major companies.

Practical programming classes began with an introduction to Python basics. I was surprised at how quickly time flies when writing code.

Outside of classes, I got to know my classmates â€” we prepared together for an economics seminar. It feels like a lot of interesting things lie ahead.
