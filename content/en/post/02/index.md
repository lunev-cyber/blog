## ðŸ“Œ Week of June 2 to June 8

The week turned out to be eventful. We took a test in mathematical analysis â€” the tasks were more challenging than I expected, but the experience was valuable.

In business process practice, we started working on a group project: modeling the business process of an online store. We created a BPMN diagram â€” it turned out to be more interesting than it sounded.

I also began exploring SQL â€” the database homework really made me work hard.
