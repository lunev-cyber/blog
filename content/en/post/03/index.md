## ðŸ“Œ Week of June 9 to June 15

The main event of the week was active preparation for exams. In the evenings, we gathered at the library â€” working together to solve economics problems and creating cheat sheets for information theory (just for knowledge checking ðŸ˜‰).

In programming class, we worked on a mini-project: a simple expense tracking application. It was useful to apply theory in practice.

It was a bit tough to balance studying and sports, but I managed to make it to volleyball practice.
