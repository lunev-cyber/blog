## ðŸ“Œ Week of June 16 to June 22

The exam session was in full swing. We took the economics exam â€” the questions were quite challenging, but preparation paid off. The programming exam went better than I expected: the tasks on loops and arrays were quite manageable.

I realized that during exams, having a clear answer plan and the ability to quickly highlight the key points helps the most.

After classes, we would go out on campus with friends â€” just to get some fresh air and discuss how the exams went.
