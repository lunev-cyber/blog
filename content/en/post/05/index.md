## ðŸ“Œ Week of June 23 to June 29

The exam session is over! We took the last exam in databases. The results are encouraging â€” no failed subjects so far. Iâ€™m really glad I managed to handle such a large amount of information in a short time.

This week there was finally time to relax: we went on a tour around Moscow with friends, and I finally got a chance to read for pleasure.

I plan to improve my English and dive deeper into SQL over the summer â€” lots of new things ahead!
