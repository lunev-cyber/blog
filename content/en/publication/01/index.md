## What is version control?

Version control is the process of tracking and managing changes in code, documentation, and other project files. A version control system (VCS):

- keeps a history of changes,
- allows you to revert to previous versions,
- simplifies teamwork,
- helps prevent data loss.

Such systems are indispensable in team development, large projects, and scientific computing.

## Why Git?

**Git** is the most popular distributed version control system. Its main advantages:

- 🔹 **Local data storage** — you can work without a constant internet connection; all changes are saved on your computer.
- 🔹 **Speed and efficiency** — Git is optimized to handle even large projects.
- 🔹 **Flexibility** — you can create branches, merge changes, and experiment without risk to the main project version.
- 🔹 **Transparent change history** — each commit has metadata showing who made the change, when, and why.

## Key features of Git

With Git, you can:

- 📌 **Initialize a repository** and start tracking project files.
- 🔄 **Commit changes** with a description of each update.
- 🌿 **Create and switch between branches** to develop new features alongside the main version.
- 🔀 **Merge branches** and combine changes from different contributors.
- ⚡ **Track and resolve conflicts** when merging changes.
- ⬆ **Work with remote repositories** (e.g., on GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).

## How does Git help in studies and work?

For students and researchers, Git is useful in many situations:

- 💻 When developing software or scripts for research.
- 📄 For versioning theses, coursework, articles, and documentation.
- 🤝 For team projects, ensuring everyone works on the same files without risking data loss or overwriting each other's work.
- 🧪 For tracking experiments and data versions.

## Conclusion

Git is a powerful tool that simplifies project management, helps avoid mistakes, and makes collaboration more efficient. Mastering Git is an important step for anyone working in programming, data analysis, or research.

Regular use of version control fosters a disciplined work style and improves the quality of your projects.
