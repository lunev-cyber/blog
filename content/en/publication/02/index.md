## What is Markdown?

**Markdown** is a lightweight markup language designed for quickly writing text with a simple structure. Its main goal is to make the text easily readable in its raw form and convenient to convert into HTML and other formats.

Markdown is often used for:

- ✏ writing documentation;
- 📝 creating README files;
- 🌐 publishing in blogs and on forums;
- 📄 drafting notes and study materials.

## Basic principles

Markdown aims for maximum readability: even in raw form, the text looks clean. Markup is added using symbols familiar from everyday typing — `#`, `*`, `_`, `-`, and others.

## Markdown capabilities

Here are the key elements you can format with Markdown:

- **Headings** — marked with `#`. The number of `#` symbols indicates the heading level.
- **Lists** — created with `-`, `*`, or numbers followed by a period for bullet and numbered lists.
- **Bold and italic** — `**text**` for bold, `*text*` for italic.
- **Code** — insert code fragments with backticks (`` ` ``), and code blocks with triple backticks (```).
- **Links** — `[link text](URL)`
- **Images** — `![alt text](image URL)`
- **Blockquotes** — lines starting with `>`.
- **Horizontal lines** — three or more `-` or `*` on a line.

- static site generators (e.g., Hugo, Jekyll);
- blogs, including academic ones;
